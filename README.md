## 📖 About

NepaliLang (.NEP) is a toy programming language developed in TypeScript. This project, also known as the Nepali compiler, is currently in its first version and will be updated regularly to incorporate new features and improvements.

Inspired by Bhailang and leveraging the flexibility of TypeScript, NepaliLang aims to create a fun and educational programming experience using Nepali language-based syntax.

## 🚀 Features

- 🇳🇵 Nepali-based syntax for easier understanding by Nepali speakers
- 🧮 Support for variables, conditionals, loops, and functions
- 🔢 Basic arithmetic and comparison operations
- 🖨️ Print statements using `nikaal`

## 🎮 Try It Out

Experience NepaliLang in our interactive [DocsPlayground](https://dotnep.xyz/playground).

> 📢 npm package coming soon!

## 🌟 Basic Syntax

Here's a quick example of NepaliLang code:

```nepali
nikaal "Hello World";
rakh a = 3;

yedi (a < 3){
    nikaal "a chai 3 bhanda syano chha";
} navaye (a == 3){
    nikaal "a chai 3 chha";
} haina bhane {
    nikaal "a chai 3 bhanda thulo chha";
}
```

## 📚 Documentation

For detailed documentation on NepaliLang syntax and features, please refer to our [Documentation](https://dotnep.xyz/).

### Key Concepts

* 📝 Variables are declared using `rakh`
* 🔀 Conditionals use `yedi`, `navaye`, and `haina bhane`
* 🔁 Loops are created with `jaba samma`
* 🛠️ Functions are defined using `kaam` or `kaam ra firta`
* ✅ Boolean values are represented by `sahi` and `galat`

## 💻 Supported Operations

* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* Comparison: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
* Increment/Decrement: `++`, `--`

> ⚠️ Note: Logical, bitwise, and assignment operators are not supported in the current version.
